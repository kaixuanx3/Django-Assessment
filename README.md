# Django Assessment

## Overview

Django Assessment is a Django web application designed to manage and display the results of games in a sports league. Users can upload a CSV file containing game results, view a ranking table based on the uploaded data, and perform actions like adding, editing, and deleting games through the web interface.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to implement a Django web application that meets the following requirements:

- Allow users to upload a CSV file containing game results.
- Display a ranking table based on the uploaded data.
- Enable users to add, edit, and delete games from the list.
- Calculate points for each game (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss).
- Rank teams based on points and alphabetical order in case of ties.
